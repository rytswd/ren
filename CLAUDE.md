# Project Context for Claude

`ren` (練) is a lightweight Zig library for sophisticated terminal output rendering. The name comes from 洗練 (senren), meaning "refined" or "sophisticated" - reflecting the project's philosophy: simple, small, and sophisticated.

**Key Information:**
- **Language**: Zig (master branch / v0.16 candidate)
- **Standard Library**: Use `std.Io` (capitalized), `std.mem`, `std.unicode`, etc.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Only Zig stdlib
- **Documentation**: Follow https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/
- **Philosophy**: Simple, small, sophisticated output utilities

This project uses Air for documentation-driven development.
Please review these context files to understand the project:

## Essential Context
Review these files for project understanding:
- @./air/context/OVERVIEW.md
- @./air/context/air-conventions.md
- @./air/context/air-workflow.md
- @./air/context/architecture.md
- @./air/context/implementation-guide.md
- @./air/context/interface-design.md

## Planning Documents
For detailed specifications, browse the Air directory structure:
- `./air/v0.1/` - V0.1 specifications
- Use `airctl status` to see document states and progress

## Before Implementation
1. Check current status: `airctl status --state work-in-progress,ready`
2. See all ready work: `airctl status --state ready`
3. Read the relevant Air document in ./air
4. Follow conventions in ./air/context/air-conventions.md
5. Update Implementation History after completing work

## Getting Current Project Status
Always use airctl commands for up-to-date information:
- `airctl status` - Full project status
- `airctl status --state ready` - Work ready for implementation
- `airctl status --state work-in-progress` - Currently active work
- `airctl status --by-tag` - Group by feature tags

## Creating New Features
For features without Air docs:
1. Create an Air document first if the feature is complex
2. Use format shown in ./air/context/air-workflow.md
3. Set initial state to 'draft'
4. Get approval before moving to 'ready' state

## Important Notes
- Always check existing Air docs before implementing
- Update document state when work is complete (use `airctl update` when available)
- Follow the workflow described in context files
- Keep Implementation History sections current
